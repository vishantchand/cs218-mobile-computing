# CS218 – Mobile Computing | Assignment 1
---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates practical skills in **mobile networking, live streaming, and mobile application development**. It consists of three parts, each showcasing different technical competencies:

1. **Mobile Network Management & Roaming (Part 1)**  
2. **Live Stream Production & Post-Production (Part 2)**  
3. **Mobile Application Development & Middleware Analysis (Part 3)**  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

### Part 1 – Mobile Network Management & Roaming
**Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer, HTML, DHCP configuration  
**Skills Gained:**  
- Designing and configuring a mobile network with **routers, switches, access points, servers, and cell towers**.  
- Implementing **DHCP services** to assign IPs automatically.  
- Ensuring **network connectivity** across devices (laptops, smartphones, IoT devices) including roaming between home and foreign networks.  
- Developing an **interactive web page (`index.html`)** with:  
  - Login form  
  - Student details and photo  
  - Fun fact simulator with multiple entries  
- Demonstrated **network troubleshooting and verification** using ping tests.  

---

### Part 2 – Live Stream Production
**Tools Used:** OBS Studio (or alternative), video editing software  
**Skills Gained:**  
- Planning and executing a **10-minute multi-camera live stream**.  
- Switching between multiple camera feeds and scenes (screen share, graphics).  
- **Post-production editing**: cuts, titles, audio optimization.  
- Capturing and analyzing **performance metrics**: latency, frame rate, CPU usage.  
- Demonstrated **team collaboration and communication** for live broadcast execution.  

---

### Part 3 – Mobile Application Development
**Tools Used:** Flutter (or React Native), Figma / Adobe XD  
**Skills Gained:**  
- Designing a **mobile app UI/UX** with 5–7 screen mockups, including home, playlist, and playback screens.  
- Building a **functional prototype** to manage playlists, add media, and play audio/video.  
- Conducting a **middleware analysis**: comparing frameworks (e.g., Flutter vs Firebase/native), explaining pros/cons, and describing middleware role in the mobile computing protocol stack.  
- Applied principles of **user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and cross-platform development**.
